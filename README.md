# Mastermind Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Mastermind** game, created as part of a programming class.
In this game, players try to guess a hidden code within a limited number of attempts. 
Feedback is provided after each guess to help players narrow down the correct answer.

## Features

- Random code generation for each new game
- Feedback on guesses: indicates correct colors in correct and incorrect positions
- User-friendly console interface
- Limited number of attempts to guess the correct code

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Julian97s/mastermind.git


## How to Play

- Start the game in your console by running the commands above.
- Enter your guesses according to the prompt. Each guess should match the number of code "slots" (e.g., if the code has 4 colors, you should guess 4 colors).
- After each guess, you'll receive feedback to help you:
- Correct color in the correct position
- Correct color but in the wrong position
- Try to guess the code within the allowed number of attempts to win!
